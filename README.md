# xMETAR for Flow Pro

This is an addon for Flow Pro by //42 (Parallel 42). It adds the command _xmetar_ and _xm_ to the _Otto Search Bar_ of Flow Pro.
With this command you can get METAR information for any airport in the sim. If the airport does not have a METAR message, the
widget takes the one nearest to the airport.

All data will be visualized inside a window of Flow Pro. There are Otto commands to show, hide and toggle the window.
